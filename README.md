# Musoq
Musoq is handy tool that decouples queries from the database. You can query whatever you want.

It tries to decouple those queries from the database. Would you like to query multiple folders that fits some sophisticated conditions? No problem! Perform data analysis on CSV from your bank account? That's why Musoq was created for. It can do things that databases can't do easily like adding/extending your own grouping operators, taking calculations on parent groups, works on objects and access their properties. You also don't need schema to query your datas.
